<h3>17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h3>
<p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION CAREFULLY.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.</p>
<strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>
<p>Any dispute, difference, controversy or claim between us or by either of us against the other or the employees, agents, mandataries, officers, directors, successors, assigns or affiliates of the other, arising out of, relating to, or having any connection with, the present terms, this website, any use of this website and any transaction conducted on or from it (whether contractual or extra-contractual, in contract or tort, pursuant to statute or regulation, or otherwise, and whether pre-existing, present or future), including any question regarding negotiation, formation, existence, validity, performance, effects, interpretation, breach, resolution or annulment and further including the applicability or scope of this arbitration clause (including the National Arbitration Forum's Code of Procedure discussed below) (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Claims" and each, individually, as a "Claim") shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration, to the exclusion of courts of law, before or under the rules of the National Arbitration Forum under the Code of Procedure then in effect and any specific procedures for the resolution of small claims and/or consumer disputes then in effect (which you may obtain at www.arbitration-forum.com or by mail at P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405), which Code of Procedure, as in effect or replaced from time to time, is incorporated into and forms an integral part of these terms.
However, before you submit a Claim for arbitration, you must first contact our customer service representatives at customer@fd9group.com, and give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Similarly, before FD9 takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you. If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved within sixty (60) days from the date you or FD9 is notified by the other of a dispute, then either party may then initiate the arbitration process as provided in the National Arbitration Forum's Code of Procedure.</p>
<p>For greater certainty, no recourse may be made by either party to any court or tribunal, whether federal or provincial, in respect of any matter whatsoever relating to these terms including, without limitation, any Claim, any arbitration initiated to resolve a Claim, and any arbitration award made in relation to a Claim, except as expressly permitted in these terms or by law. Any award rendered pursuant to the arbitration shall be final and binding on each of the parties and no appeal shall lie from such award. Such award may be rendered enforceable and executory by any court having jurisdiction over the person or the property of the person against whom enforcement of the award is sought.</p>
<p>No claim may be joined with another lawsuit, or in an arbitration with a dispute of any other person, or resolved on a class-wide basis. The parties expressly agree that any claim that is arbitrated pursuant to this agreement shall not be consolidated with any other arbitral proceeding for any reason. The arbitrator may not award damages that are barred by this agreement and may not award exemplary or punitive damages or attorneys' fees. You and FD9 both waive any claims for an award of damages that are excluded under this agreement.</p>
<strong>INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PROVISIONAL RELIEF</strong>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions in this Section 13, the National Arbitration Forum's Code of Procedure or any other provision of this Agreement, FD9 shall have the right to seek and obtain any injunctive, provisional or interim relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its trade-mark or other intellectual property rights or confidential information or to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.</p>
<h3>19. EXPORT LAWS</h3>
<p>Products sold or delivered under this Agreement shall be subject to export control laws and regulations of the United States. You agree to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations. You will defend and hold FD9 harmless against all claims, damages or liability resulting from breach of the foregoing.</p>

<h3>22.  ENUREMENT</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<h3>23.  SEVERABILITY</h3>
<p>The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
